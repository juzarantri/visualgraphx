            },
            {
                "q": "Can these decals be used outdoors in rain or sun?",
                "a": "Yes, absolutely. Our decals are weather-resistant and hold up well in sun, rain, and everyday outdoor conditions."
            },
            {
                "q": "Will decals damage walls, windows, or car paint when removed?",
                "a": "Nope. As long as the surface was clean before application, the decals peel off without leaving messy residue or damaging paint or glass."
            },
            {
                "q": "Can I reuse or reposition my decals?",
                "a": "They're designed for one-time use, so once they're applied, they'll stick firmly. If you're looking for reusable options, we can suggest cling material instead."
            },
            {
                "q": "Are these decals dishwasher safe if used on mugs or bottles?",
                "a": "For drinkware, we recommend hand-washing to keep the print looking fresh. They'll survive a few dishwasher cycles, but hand-wash is the safe bet."
            },
            {
                "q": "Do you offer decals for floor graphics or high-traffic areas?",
                "a": "Yes, we do. We use a heavier laminate for floor decals so they hold up under foot traffic and can be slip-resistant."
            },
            {
                "q": "Are the decals see-through or fully opaque?",
                "a": "By default, they're opaque for strong colors. But if you need clear decals or see-through window graphics, we can print those too."
            },
            {
                "q": "Can I apply decals myself, or do I need professional help?",
                "a": "You can definitely do it yourself. We'll guide you with simple steps — just clean the surface, peel, and smooth it down. For larger decals, having two people helps a lot."
